    `Hey! I'm an AI/ML Engineer & Systems Architect from Prayagraj, India.`,

    `I'm studying Computer Science & Data Science at UIT, primarily working on high-reliability Computer Vision, Edge AI, and production-ready inference pipelines @ Promptly AI and Empyrean Robotics.`,

    `In 2019, severe medical adversity triggered what I call "Operation Rebirth". I transitioned directly into builder mode. Today, the <span style="color: var(--amber)">"Tier-3 to CEO"</span> mindset fuels my drive to build for India's strategic defense and infrastructure (#build4bharat).`,

    `I've built and shipped complex architectures—from decentralized drone swarm logic (Project VYUHA) to hardware-free adaptive traffic systems (FlowSync AI). I'm an AI generalist, but to see the architectures I usually build, check the map sectors.`,

    `I also grind computational mathematics; I'm rated 1700+ in CP, have solved 840+ DSA problems, and recently won the ICUB8 2025 national hackathon.`,

    `Previously: Logistics & Ops Head for Google Student Ambassadors (Pan-India), managing automated operations for 110+ campus leads.`,

    `At my core, I love building fault-tolerant infrastructure and safety-critical systems. If you're building something ambitious, let's talk!`,
